# BwE PS5 NOR Validator

PS5 NOR Validator in alpha stage, designed to validate and interpret the semi-encrypted firmware of a PS5. At this stage the data used to validate the entropy and statistic of the firmware is rough. Given the current state of the application, it should not be used to validate. Wait for future updates!
