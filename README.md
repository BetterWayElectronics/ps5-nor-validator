# BwE PS5 NOR Validator

BwE PS5 NOR Validator (Pre-Alpha). Designed to validate the entire raw and semi-encrypted firmware of a PlayStation 5. Created using Perl. Not recommended for use at this stage. Please wait for future developments and additional flash dumps. The next update will actually begin to extract and validate the individual files within the flash.
